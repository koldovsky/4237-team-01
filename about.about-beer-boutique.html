        <h2 class="about-boutique__heading">PROCESS OF CREATING</h2>
        <p>Our main goal has always been to create a pub with the best selection of beers and simple food.</p>
        <p>Our selection of beers is a result of long and scrupulous experiments that give us thousands of taste combinations. Each and every beer of ours has a unique recipe and a solid standard of preparation, supervised closely by our beer masters. We want you to feel all the richness of an original draft beer and also offer a wide variety of bottled beers from the best local producers.</p>
